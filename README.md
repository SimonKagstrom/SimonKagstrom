## Simon K√•gstr√∂m

Welcome to my profile! I'm a consultant software developer specializing in embedded systems. I enjoy working with Linux systems as well as MCU-based systems with e.g., FreeRTOS but I've also done a few Qt applications, for both Linux and MacOS. My main language is C++, but I'm also fluent in C, Python and CMake (plus bash etc).

If you're interested in having me as a consultant, feel free to contact me!

## Featured projects
I do a lot of open source work in my spare time, which is available here. A few of the highlights are:

- [maelir](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/maelir): An ESP32-based GPS plotter for classic boats, written in modern C++
- [kcov](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov): A code coverage tool for Linux/FreeBSD/MacOS using breakpoints for coverage collection
- [emilpro](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/emilpro): A Qt-based graphical disassembler for multiple architectures
- [cibyl](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/cibyl): (older, but a favourite of mine) A binary translator for MIPS to Java bytecode, used to run C/C++ programs on J2ME phones
