## Simon K√•gstr√∂m

Welcome to my profile! I'm a consultant software developer specializing in embedded systems. I enjoy working with Linux systems as well as MCU-based systems with e.g., FreeRTOS but I've also done a few Qt applications, for both Linux and MacOS. My main language is C++, but I'm also fluent in C, Python and CMake (plus bash etc).

If you're interested in having me as a consultant, feel free to contact me!
